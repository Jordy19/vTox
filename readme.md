# vTox - *Discord Bot*

vTox is just like any other Discord bot, it's a small project that I started to get myself familiar with the development of Discord Bots.

## Getting started

vTox is build with the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API Wrapper.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.5.3 *(Version 3.5.3 or higher is required)*
- discord
- asyncio

**Installation**
1. Create your bot at the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Make sure that you have the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)  library installed.
3. Edit `config-example.yml` and rename it to `config.yml`
4. `python vtox.py`
